# Goals:
# - Keep notebook history clean (strip outputs before commit)
# - Avoid unreadable JSON diffs in Git by default
# - Keep line endings consistent across OSes
# - Optionally enable a dedicated notebook diff driver (requires extra setup)
# ==============================================================================

# Treat notebooks as JSON for GitHub linguist (language stats / display)
*.ipynb linguist-language=JSON

# Strip notebook outputs on commit using a Git filter named "strip-notebook-output"
# (configured via `git config filter.strip-notebook-output.*`, executed in Podman)
*.ipynb filter=strip-notebook-output

# Default: disable notebook diffs (raw JSON diffs are noisy and not review-friendly)
*.ipynb -diff

# Normalize line endings across platforms
* text=auto eol=lf

# OPTIONAL: enable a notebook-specific diff driver.
# This line is intentionally last so you can switch behavior easily:
# - Keep `*.ipynb -diff` to disable diffs (recommended for simplicity), OR
# - Comment out `*.ipynb -diff` above and keep the line below to enable diffs.
*.ipynb diff=jupyternotebook
